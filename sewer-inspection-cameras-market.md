<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sewer Inspection Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Push Rod Type</li><li>Crawler Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sewer inspection camera market consists of two primary types: push rod and crawler cameras. Push rod cameras are handheld devices that use a flexible rod to maneuver through pipes, making them ideal for smaller diameter sewer lines and easier access in tight spaces. Crawler cameras, on the other hand, are equipped with a wheeled or tracked robot that navigates larger, more complex sewer systems autonomously, providing enhanced stability and comprehensive imaging over extended distances. Both types enhance pipeline inspection efficiency and accuracy.</p></p>
