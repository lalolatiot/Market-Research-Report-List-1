<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPDM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Polymerization</li><li>Suspension Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EPDM market is primarily segmented into two types based on the polymerization process: solution polymerization and suspension polymerization. Solution polymerization involves dissolving the monomers in an organic solvent, producing a smooth, high-purity product with controlled molecular weight, ideal for applications in automotive and roofing. In contrast, suspension polymerization occurs in an aqueous medium, leading to a more granular product with a higher degree of control over particle size, suitable for various industrial applications. Both methods contribute uniquely to the versatility of EPDM materials.</p></p>
