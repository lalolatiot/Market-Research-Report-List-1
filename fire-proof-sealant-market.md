<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-Proof Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type Sealants</li><li>Intumescent Type Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire-proof sealant market primarily consists of two types: elastomeric and intumescent sealants. Elastomeric sealants are flexible and can expand or contract, providing excellent adhesion and sealing capabilities against fire and smoke. They are ideal for applications requiring movement accommodation. In contrast, intumescent sealants expand when exposed to heat, forming a char that blocks flames and smoke, making them effective for fuse boxes and cable trays. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing the fire safety of buildings and infrastructure.</p></p>
